# Personal Introduction Webpage

This project is a simple, single‑page personal introduction website created to practice semantic HTML and foundational CSS. It demonstrates my ability to structure content clearly, separate presentation from layout using an external stylesheet, and follow basic project‑scoping principles. The page includes my academic goals, professional interests, personal hobbies, and a link to my GitHub profile.
