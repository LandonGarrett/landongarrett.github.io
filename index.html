    <h2>Agricultural Science Major & Sustainable Agriculture Enthusiast</h2>

    <p>I am returning to school after an eight-year break, and one of my main goals is to build strong technical and organizational skills. This course helps me practice planning, structuring, and presenting information clearly.</p>

    <p>I also want to strengthen my understanding of web development tools like Markdown and GitHub so I can use them effectively in academic and professional projects.</p>
